Welcome to **rdll-rs**, a powerful template for developing reflective DLLs in Rust. This repository provides a structured way to create dynamic link libraries (DLLs) that can be used in various applications. With this template, you can harness the performance and safety of Rust while creating reusable components.

## Introduction

Dynamic link libraries (DLLs) are essential for creating modular applications. They allow you to load code at runtime, enabling better memory management and easier updates. With **rdll-rs**, you can create DLLs that reflectively expose their functionality, making it easier to interact with them from other languages or systems.

## Features

- **Reflective Functionality**: Easily expose functions and types for dynamic discovery.
- **Rust Safety**: Leverage Rust's memory safety features.
- **Cross-Platform**: Build DLLs for Windows, Linux, and macOS.
- **Easy Integration**: Simple APIs to integrate with other programming languages.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you start, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install): The Rust programming language.
- [Cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html): Rust's package manager and build system.

### Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Anwar8320307/rdll-rs.git
cd rdll-rs
```

### Building the DLL

To build the DLL, run:

```bash
cargo build --release
```

This command compiles the project in release mode, generating the DLL in the `target/release` directory.

## Usage

To use the DLL in your project, load it dynamically. Hereâ€™s a simple example in Rust:

```rust
use std::ffi::CString;
use libloading::{Library, Symbol};

fn main() {
    let lib = Library::new("path_to_your_dll.dll").unwrap();
    unsafe {
        let func: Symbol<unsafe extern fn() -> i32> = lib.get(b"your_function_name").unwrap();
        println!("Result: {}", func());
    }
}
```

## Examples

### Example 1: Basic Function

In this example, we will create a simple function that adds two numbers.

1. Create a new Rust file in the `src` directory, for example, `lib.rs`.
2. Add the following code:

```rust
#[no_mangle]
pub extern "C" fn add(a: i32, b: i32) -> i32 {
    a + b
}
```

3. Build the DLL and use it in your application as shown in the previous section.

### Example 2: Reflective Functionality

To demonstrate reflective functionality, we can create a function that returns the number of functions exported by the DLL.

1. Add the following code to `lib.rs`:

```rust
#[no_mangle]
pub extern "C" fn get_function_count() -> i32 {
    1 // Adjust this number based on the actual number of exported functions
}
```

2. Build the DLL and call `get_function_count` from your application.
